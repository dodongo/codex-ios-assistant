# Codex iOS Assistant

Codex iOS Assistant lets Codex on a Mac control an iPhone. The `iphone` CLI sends private commands through iMessage. An iOS Shortcut runs the requested action and returns context from your iPhone back to your Mac.

> [!TIP]
> This project is meant to be installed with Codex! To install it, please paste this message into a new Codex thread on your Mac:
>
> ```text
> Please set up the `dodongo/codex-ios-assistant` GitHub project. I want to get it working on my own Mac and iPhone with Tailscale Serve. Notify me when my input is required. Otherwise, please set up this project entirely on your own.

## Supported commands

- Capture the iPhone screen for direct image inspection.
- Read and replace the clipboard.
- List enabled alarms, create an alarm, or disable alarms at a given time.
- Open Camera, Weather, Calendar, Calculator, Messages, Find My, Spotify, Photos, Wallet, Notes, Books, App Store, Uber, and DoorDash.
- Open the Home Screen or Control Center; control timers, the flashlight, and Low Power Mode; place calls.
- Search Mac Contacts and read the Mac's Messages database.

Message composition opens a draft for review. The CLI does not send ordinary messages, buy anything, install apps, order food, or request rides.

## How it works

```mermaid

    A["ChatGPT app on iPhone"] -->|Remote session| B["Codex on Mac"]
    B --> C["iphone CLI + skill"]
    C -->|Unix socket| D["Messages sender LaunchAgent"]

    E --> F["Native iOS action"]
    E -->|authenticated HTTPS response| G["Tailscale Serve"]
    G --> H["receiver on Mac loopback"]
    H --> C
```

The Messages sender runs as a per-user LaunchAgent. This keeps Messages automation outside the Codex sandbox, where LaunchServices may be unable to resolve `com.apple.MobileSMS`.

See [Architecture and protocol](docs/architecture.md) for request formats and trust boundaries.

## Requirements

- A Mac running macOS 14 or newer, with Python 3.11+, Messages, and Xcode Command Line Tools.
- An iPhone that receives messages sent to the configured iMessage address.
- Tailscale signed into the same tailnet on the Mac and iPhone.
- MagicDNS and HTTPS enabled for the tailnet.
- iCloud sync for Shortcuts.

The ChatGPT desktop and mobile apps are required only for the Remote workflow.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dodongo/codex-ios-assistant.git
cd codex-ios-assistant
brew install steipete/tap/imsg
./scripts/install
./scripts/setup-tailscale
./scripts/install-services
./scripts/copy-shortcut
```

Configuration has three values: the iMessage address that reaches your iPhone, the Mac's private Tailscale HTTPS origin, and a generated receiver token. The installer derives the origin from `tailscale status` and stores the values in `~/.config/codex-ios-assistant/`, outside the repository.

`scripts/copy-shortcut` puts 95 native Shortcuts actions on the Mac clipboard. Paste them once into a blank shortcut and name it `iOS Assistant`. After iCloud syncs it to your iPhone, create the automation that listens for commands:

1. Open Shortcuts > Automation, tap the plus sign at the bottom, then choose New Automation > Message.
2. Under `When I receive a message where`, set `Sender is` to your own iMessage contact.
3. Tap `Add Filter` and set `Message contains` to `hola`.
4. Tap `Run Shortcut` and select `iOS Assistant`.

You must create this automation by hand in the Shortcuts app on your iPhone. Follow the [installation guide](docs/installation.md) for the remaining Apple permissions.

## Test the setup

```bash
iphone doctor
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
iphone home
iphone screen capture --timeout 30
iphone alarm list --timeout 30
```

`iphone home` returns `requested` after Messages accepts the command. Commands that wait for data from the phone, including `screen capture` and `alarm list`, return `completed` after the matching response reaches the Mac.
